## 8:00AM - Bug Fix - too many state updates causing unnecessary renders

### Challenge/Motivation
Page looks like it's having a seizure when it's loaded.

### Actions Taken
Debugging revealed the issue comes about in the parent reviews component, I was using set state after each axios request, using only one set state once all of the requests are finished keeps too many renders from happening.

### Results Observed
The page only renders once.

## 11:00AM - Create Product Rating Sliders

### Challenge/Motivation
Semantic UI has no offerings that allow me to fulfill the product rating slider. I'll have to make one from scratch with JavaScript and CSS. Each slider is made up of 3 thin grey inline blocks, with an upside down triangle representing a 0-5 star rating on the slider.

### Actions Taken
Create sliders, read up on some CSS since it isn't one of my stronger skills, update the slider CSS to visually match the page, margins, etc.

### Results Observed
It took me a lot longer than I thought to create these sliders. Initially creating them was easy, it's just a thin grey line that has a triangle on it.

What tripped me up is how the rest of my symantic components are laid out on the page. They have their own margins and padding, so I had to match my sliders to the columns above them. I learned a lot about CSS today, and I'd really like to make more of my components from scratch (without a framework) if I have time on this project.
