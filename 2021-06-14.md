## 10:30AM - Individual reviews in the review list have a helpfulness counter that the user should be able to click and rate the question as helpful to them.

### Challenge/Motivation
The 'yes' string in the footer needs to be clickable. Upon clicking, send an update in an axios request. Unsure how to format the axios request.


### Actions Taken
Read API documents for this specific query.
Update the hard coded yes to be clickable. When clicked, send an axios request to increment the helpfulness count, upon success update state to reflect that review's helpfulness rating.


### Results Observed
This was a bit more involved than I expected. At the end, I had to initialize state to track whether the user had clicked the button, which is local to each review, and

## 12:00PM - Reviews in the review list need to be sorted by relevance, helpfulness or newest.

### Challenge/Motivation
The sort method is chosen through a dropdown menu. Upon the user making a selection, a function is triggered that sends an axios request to the server with the chosen sort method as a parameter.


### Actions Taken
1. Create an onChange handler function.
2. onChange handler function will make an axios request with the user's chosen sort method.
3. Server will respond with *all* of the reviews sorted accordingly.
4. Update state
5. DOM updates with the same number of newly sorted reviews as there were already rendered to the page when the user changed the sort method.

### Results Observed
I unintentionally bound my helper function to another function:

```
constructor(props) {
  super(props);

  this.state = {
    // state
    // state
    // state
  };

  this.addReviews = this.addReviews.bind(this);
  this.sortReviews = this.addReviews.bind(this);
}
```

As you can guess, binding ```sortReviews``` to ```addReviews``` impedes it from working as I intended. This unfortunate mistake doesn't produce an error, so I had to go entirely up and down the chain of components that ```sortReviews``` was used in.


After fixing this self inflicted bug, I wrote an onChange handler function to call the axios request and update state with the newly sorted reviews.

## 1:00PM - Write New Review form requires a feature to add photos to the review

### Challenge/Motivation
The API documentation we were given says that the database expects an array of strings representing the url of images to render.
The business requirements we were given says we need to be able to select the images from a popup window, which means the client isn't expecting their users to paste in URL's.
