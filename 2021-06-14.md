## 10:30AM - Individual reviews in the review list have a helpfulness counter that show the user how many people have rated the review as helpful. User needs to be able to rate the review as helpful by clicking on the counter.

### Challenge/Motivation
The ```yes``` string in the footer needs to be clickable. Upon clicking, send an update in an axios request. Unsure how to format the axios request.


### Actions Taken
Read API documents for this specific query.
Update the hard coded ```yes``` to be clickable. When clicked, send an axios request to increment the helpfulness count. Upon success update state to reflect that review's helpfulness rating.


### Results Observed
This was a bit more involved than I expected. I had to initialize state to track whether the user had clicked the button. This state is local to each review.

## 12:00PM - Reviews in the review list need to be sorted by relevance, helpfulness or newest.

### Challenge/Motivation
The sort method is chosen through a dropdown menu. Upon the user making a selection, a function is triggered that sends an axios request to the server with the chosen sort method as a parameter.


### Actions Taken
1. Create an onChange handler function.
2. onChange handler function will make an axios request with the user's chosen sort method.
3. Server will respond with *all* of the reviews sorted accordingly.
4. Update state
5. DOM updates with the same number of newly sorted reviews as there were already rendered to the page when the user changed the sort method.

### Results Observed
I unintentionally bound my helper function to another function:

```
constructor(props) {
  super(props);

  this.state = {
    // state
    // state
    // state
  };

  this.addReviews = this.addReviews.bind(this);
  this.sortReviews = this.addReviews.bind(this);
}
```

As you can guess, binding ```sortReviews``` to ```addReviews``` impedes it from working as I intended. This unfortunate mistake doesn't produce an error, so I had to go entirely up and down the chain of components that ```sortReviews``` was used in.


After fixing this self inflicted bug, I wrote an onChange handler function to call the axios request and update state with the newly sorted reviews.

## 2:30PM - Ensure that when a user marks a review as helpful, the review list is re-sorted if necessary.

### Challenge/Motivation
If two reviews have been marked helpful the same number of time and a user marks one as helpful, that review will need to move up the list. This requires a re-sorting of the reviews.


### Actions Taken
1. Rewrite the sorting function I built in the previous task to take in the current sort method from state so it can be called when a user clicks on the helpful counter.
2. Import the sorting function into the button that marks a review as helpful.

### Results Observed
This was pretty easy to implement once I figured out that I could just store the current sort method in state as a default. If the user isn't changing the sorting method, there's no reason to pass a sorting method. Reusing the sorting method this way makes my code more ```DRY```. (```D```on't ```R```epeat ```Y```ourself.)

## 5:00PM - Filter reviews based on stars

### Challenge/Motivation
When a user clicks on a star rating in the review breakdown, filter the review list so that only ratings of equal or higher value are displayed.


### Actions Taken
1. Create state that holds an array of filters.
2. When a filter is selected (in this case, star rating) add the filter to state.
3. Immediately loop through all reviews and push the reviews that pass the test into a new array.
4. Render these filtered reviews to the list.
5. These filters need to be a configuration for every sort/add review function.


### Results Observed
Reviews can now be filtered based on star rating. The reviews stay in the order they come in from the database, but are only displayed if they meet the filter criteria.

## 9:00PM - Allow user to write a new review and post it to the database

### Challenge/Motivation
The form to collect all data relating to a new review is complete, minus the ability to add photos. Posting to the server is the next step.


### Actions Taken
1. Make sure all the input fields in the form update the state
2. Create axios request that posts the new review to the database

### Results Observed
Creating the axios request was pretty easy, the documentation seemed to make sense. I did have some trouble figuring out if I needed to put the parameters in ```body``` or ```data``` but a quick glance at the documentation fixed my confusion. This task was a real time drain, setting up the forms was very tedious. I still need to set up validation for each input and handle errors if an input isn't filled out properly.

## 12:00AM - Write New Review form requires a feature to add photos to the review

### Challenge/Motivation
The API documentation we were given says that the database expects an array of strings representing the URL of images to render.
The business requirements we were given say we need to be able to select the images from a popup window, which means the client isn't expecting their users to paste in URL's.
