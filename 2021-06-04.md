## 8:00AM - Task

### Challenge/Motivation
Set up ESLint to use airbnb rules along with the react-app, jest and react-hooks rules.

### Actions Taken
Research how to correctly write a config setting in package.json for linting while using create-react-app.

### Results Observed
After some researching I successfully wrote lint settings that helped the team write cleaner code that conformed to styleguide without impeding our forward progress.

## 12:30PM - Task
Install and implement semantic and dayjs

### Challenge/Motivation
The team chose semantic for our css framework and dayjs for our date formatting.

### Actions Taken
Semantic and dayjs were easy to install, dayjs needed some configuration. I spent a couple of hours reading documentation and setting up the configuration file for dayjs.

### Results Observed
I created a config file that the team can easily import into any component.
The settings I wrote allow us use a date format that resembles many social media formats. It displays "x amount of time ago" if it was less than 12 hours ago, otherwise it displays the date in Mmm, DD, YYYY, HH:MM format.

## 6:30PM - Task
Create skeleton for my product reviews component

### Challenge/Motivation
I would like to get the basic file structure in place and have filler in my components that loosely resembles the final product.

### Actions Taken
Using semantic and react components, I created a very basic first draft for my component and rendered it to the DOM.

### Results Observed
I have a much better idea of how I'm going to structure my components, which in turn helped me plan out how my state will be handled. I also have a much better idea of what child and grandchild components I will need to implement.
